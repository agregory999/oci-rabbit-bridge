# Invoke Examples

There are several ways to invoke the function, so this is not an attempt to make extra documentation.
- Pipe a JSON request to FN INvoke
- OCI Curl (for security)
- ATeam script (this directory)

From a practical standpoimnt, you can configure the function endpoint to be called via REST from products like OIC, which support the OCI Signature.
